# Making Getting to know me better App

So I tried to apply most of the techiques here about using animation, navigation, props, mapping, state, and making one full app. New things that I leanred is how to use an API with React Native, and some small things like different tags.

## Installation

1) Fall in Love with React and get your hand on the guide.
2) Install NodeJS
3) Get the command line tool "npm install expo-cli --global"
4) Creat your app "expo init my-new-project"
"cd my-new-project"
"expo start"
5) Scan the QR code
6) Find file where you saved it and start editing App.js
7) Install Navigation dependencies https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.60/navigation and follow the tutorial in the link to do so.
8) Enjoy switching between pages and creating whatever you want!

## Usage

Open the app, login in first, when you login, look through couple works that i have done, open them up if you need to see more.
Finally, go to the Jokes page and enjoy some programming jokes that I got with the Jokes API.
